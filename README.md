After completing the code writing phase firstly, I tested the CRUD application with using the localhost when I make sure there are no problem with code.
I opened a new private Github repository and uploded all files to Github with using Git Bash.
And I need to connect CRUD application with a cloud service I chose Heroku for this purpose and I linked Github and Heroku account wiht deploying Github repository to
Heroku I got this link: https://crudappp.herokuapp.com/ and I tried to /users function and I saw that program working correctly.
And I used Postman to test other functionalities of the program.
